--------------------------- Cascade and Specificity ---------------------------
Cascade:
Process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts
between different css rules and declarations, when more than one rule applies
to a certain element.

It decides which declaration applies to a certain element.
It uses the following items to decide:

Importance -> Specificity -> Source order

Importance:
CSS can come from different sources. These declarations are:h
- Author (developer declarations)
- User (for instance, user changes default font size of the browser)
- Browser (user agent/Default browser declarations)

Specificity:
1) Inline styles
2) IDs
3) Classes/Pseudo-classes/attributes
4) Elements/Pseudo-elements

Source order:
The last stylesheet declaration overrides the previous stylesheets declarations

----------------------------- Css value processing -----------------------------

- Each property has an initial value, used if nothing is declared (and if there is no inheritance)
- Browsers specify a root font-size for each page (Comes from user's declarations)
- Percentages and relative values are always converted to pixels
- Percentages are measured relative to their parent's font-size when used to specify font-sizes
- Percentages are measured relative to their parent's width if used to specify lengths (including height. There are exceptions like font-height and more)
- "em" are measured relative to their parent font-size, if used to specify font-size
- "em" are measured relative to their current element font-size, if used to specify lengths
- "rem" are always measured relative to the document's root font-size
- "vh" and "vw" are percentage measurements of the viewport's height and width

--------------------------------- Inheritance ---------------------------------
It's the mechanism that allows certain properties to be passed from parent to child elements

- Inheritance passes the values for some specific properties from parents to children (more maintainable code)
- Properties related to text are inherited (font-family, font-size, color...)
- The computed value of a property is what gets inherited, not the declared value
- Inheritance of a property only works if no one declares a value for that property
- The "inherit" keyword can be used to force inheritance on a certain property
- The "initial" keyword can be used to reset a property to its initial value
