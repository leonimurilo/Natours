Cascade:
process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts
between different css rules and declarations, when more than one rule applies
to a certain element

CSS can come from different sources. These declarations are:h
- Author (developer declarations)
- User (for instance, user changes default font size of the browser)
- Browser (user agent/Default browser declarations)
