Cascade:
process of combining different stylesheets and resolving conflicts
between different css rules and declarations, when more than one rule applies
to a certain element

Importance -> Specificity -> Source order

Importance:
CSS can come from different sources. These declarations are:h
- Author (developer declarations)
- User (for instance, user changes default font size of the browser)
- Browser (user agent/Default browser declarations)

Specificity:
1) Inline styles
2) IDs
3) Classes/Pseudo-classes/attributes
4) Elements/Pseudo-elements

Source order:
The last stylesheet declaration overrides the previous stylesheets declarations

Css value processing:
- Each property has an initial value, used if nothing is declared (and if there is no inheritance)
- Browsers specify a root font-size for each page (Comes from user's declarations)
- Percentages and relative values are always converted to pixels
- Percentages are measured relative to their parent's font-size when used to specify font-sizes
- Percentages are measured relative to their parent's width if used to specify lengths (including height)
- "em" are measured relative to their parent font-size, if used to specify font-size
- "em" are measured relative to their current element font-size, if used to specify lengths
- "rem" are always measured relative to the document's root font-size
- "vh" and "vw" are percentage measurements of the viewport's height and width
